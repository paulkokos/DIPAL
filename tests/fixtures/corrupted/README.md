# Corrupted Test Files

Intentionally malformed files for testing error handling.

## Purpose

These files test that the library properly handles:
- Invalid file headers
- Truncated files  
- Wrong file extensions
- Corrupted data

## Files

Add corrupted test files here with documentation of what makes them invalid.
