# Large Test Images

Large images for performance and stress testing.

## Warning

Files in this directory may be large (> 1MB). They are used for:
- Performance benchmarking
- Memory usage testing
- Stress testing with realistic image sizes

## Guidelines

- Mark clearly in test code when using large images
- Consider using generated images instead of stored files when possible
- Document memory requirements for tests using these images
